Tornado Web Server
---

[Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org) is a Python web framework and
asynchronous networking library, originally developed at [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com).  By using non-blocking network I/O, Tornado
can scale to tens of thousands of open connections, making it ideal for
[long polling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_Polling),
[WebSockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket), and other
applications that require a long-lived connection to each user.
